                        The Bits and Bytes Association is a club open to all students, with a focus on those within the Applied Computer Education department. They provide online social spaces, student mentoring, collaborative development projects,
                        and host industry professional Q & A sessions. They offer valuable resources for students of all ability levels and can be a great tool in developing membersâ€™ leadership, communication and technical skills.<br><br>
